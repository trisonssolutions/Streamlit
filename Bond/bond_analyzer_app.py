    This is the simplest yield calculation. It represents the annual return based on the bond's coupon payment and its current market price.
    
    - **Formula:** `Annual Coupon Payment / Current Market Price`
    - **Purpose:** Provides a quick snapshot of the return you'd get if you bought the bond and held it for one year.
    - **Limitation:** It doesn't account for the gain or loss you'll realize if you hold the bond until it matures (the difference between the market price and the face value).
    """)

with yield_tab2:
    st.subheader("Yield to Maturity (YTM)")
    st.markdown("""
    YTM is the total return an investor can expect if they hold the bond until its maturity date. It's a more comprehensive measure than current yield.
    
    - **Concept:** It includes all future coupon payments plus the difference between the current market price and the bond's face value (par value).
    - **Purpose:** It provides a standardized way to compare bonds with different coupons, market prices, and maturity dates.
    - **Note:** This calculation assumes all coupon payments are reinvested at the same rate as the YTM, which may not be realistic. The formula used here is a common approximation.

    st.markdown("""
    YTC is the total return an investor can expect if they hold a callable bond until its first call date, and the issuer *does* call the bond.
    
    - **Concept:** Similar to YTM, but it uses the call price instead of the face value and the time until the first call date instead of the time to maturity.
    - **Purpose:** Crucial for evaluating callable bonds. If a bond is trading at a premium and interest rates have fallen, there's a higher chance it will be called. Investors should be aware of the lower of YTM and YTC, known as the "Yield to Worst".

    #### Secured vs. Unsecured Corporate Debt
    
    **Secured Bonds:**
    - **Definition:** Backed by specific collateral (e.g., property, equipment, or other assets) that can be seized and sold if the issuer defaults.
    - **Risk:** Lower risk for the investor because there is a direct claim on assets in case of bankruptcy.
    - **Yield:** Tend to offer slightly lower yields than unsecured bonds from the same issuer due to the reduced risk.
    
    **Unsecured Bonds (Debentures):**
    - **Definition:** Backed only by the issuer's general creditworthiness and ability to repay, not by any specific collateral.
    - **Risk:** Higher risk for the investor. In a bankruptcy, unsecured bondholders are paid only after secured bondholders.
    - **Yield:** Must offer higher yields to compensate investors for the additional risk.

    st.markdown("""
    - **Description:** A hybrid security that combines features of a bond with those of a stock. It's a corporate bond that can be exchanged for a predetermined number of the issuing company's common stock shares.
    - **Pros:** Offers the safety of fixed coupon payments (like a bond) and the potential for capital appreciation if the stock price goes up (like a stock).
